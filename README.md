Laravel with TypeScript and reactJs in Homestead

Whenever I come up with an idea to code I struggle on which stack to choose especially when it comes to backend solutions.
I made this repo to have a good starting point for quick prototypes or to just test out new frameworks, tools etc.

### Main packages include:
- Laravel
- React
- Typescript
- Axios
- Lodash
- TailWind
- Webpack
- AntDesign
